# Django_TaskApp
Django project for a task agenda application. This project is ready to be
cloned and launched. Please note that a virtual environment is needed
with the Djando library installed. This project uses SQLite 3 with the 
CRUD operations:
- Create
- Read
- Update
- Delete

Currently, an error has been detected in the 'add a user' functionality,
new users can be created from the '/admin' tab login as a superuser. 

V1.0 is ready, currently working in improving its functionality, 
adding more features and fixing the 'add users' function.
